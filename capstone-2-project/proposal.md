# Capstone 2 - Project Proposal

## The Proposal:
1. Restaurant recommendation system for yelp based on similar users using Triadic closure.
2. Investment rental property recommendation based on Zillow and Airbnb with a focus on Austin.
3. Predict days on the market based on the quantity and quality of restaurants in the area.

## The Data:
1. https://www.yelp.com/dataset available in SQL or JSON. Contains 5,200,000 reviews, 174,000 businesses, 200,000 pictures, and 11 metropolitan areas.
2. https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon/data contains a large amount information on homes. http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html provides AirBnb information for specific regions with Austin being one of those.
3.  Using https://www.yelp.com/dataset fused with https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon/data predict how long it will take a home to sell.
