# H1 Problem Statement - Yelp Restaurant Recommendations Based on Review Network

# H2Present State:
- Yelp recommends restaurants based on location. There is also no incentive (that is evident) to submit a restaurant review.

# H2 Gap:
- There is no incentive to submit a review and restaurant recommendations are location based and personalized recommendations could incentivize users to leave more reviews.

# H2 Future State:
- As a user submits more reviews, similar users can be identified and therefore provide recommendations pertinent to the user. This recommendation would take into account the types of restaurants they leave positive reviews for and matching them to similar users and providing recommendations based on the restaurants that those users deemed “good”.
