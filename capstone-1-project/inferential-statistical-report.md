# Capstone Project 1: Inferential Statistical Analysis Report

- The direction to take the statistical analysis for this project was very clear
once the data was obtained and visualized.  It was very apparent that there was
a positive correlation between the cryptocurrency closing price and the frequency
of the its Google keyword search.

- After visualizing the data the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated
between the coin and their respective Google keyword search frequency.  This showed
that there was a very strong. positive correlation between the closing price and
the respective Google keyword search frequency for both coins.

- Equipped with this information, and new test was performed.  The test goal was
to determine if the correlation increased, decreased or remained the same if
the Google keyword search frequency data was shifted a day in the future.  In
practical terms, if the correlation increased or remained the same, the search
data would provide an insight (a day in advance) to the direction of the closing
price for the respective coin.  The result of this test showed that, yes, indeed
the Google keyword search data provides insight, a day in advance, into the direction
of the coins' closing price!
