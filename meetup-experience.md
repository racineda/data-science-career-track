### Summary:

The event began with a 30min meet and greet session.  Due to the time and location of the event I arrived 10min before the talks 
began which did not leave me much time to converse.  I did have time for some pizza and beer though!

The talks began on time with Keisuke's talk about the path he took to move into the data science field.  His personal approach was through
a company called Galvanize.  This is a 12 week, intensive program that requires full-time attendance.  This meant that maintaining a 
full-time job while attending the program would be impossible.  The program was also very expensive at $12-16k.  He graduated in June 2017
and, at the time of writing, is seeking employment.

Josh's is an undergraduate at Texas State and is studying Math with a focus on statistics & machine learning.  He presented a project, in
R, to show what a typical EDA might look like and how to address some common preliminary issues when first observing a new dataset.  This 
include missing values and incompatible data types.

Arun presented on a very complex project he collaborated on with the city of San Francisco relating to the population and their choice for
modes of transportation.  The majority of the presentation was hard to follow as it attempted to fit A LOT of information into a 15min time
slot. 

Spencer presented on the importance of github in a programmers workflow.  After surveying the room it was apparent that most everyone used
or was familiar with git and github.  This lead to a shorter presentation that went into a simple example of working alone on a git repo 
and the common commands to be familiar with.

Finally, Sam concluded the talks with docker and its usefulness in repeatability.  I found this talk to be the most helpful as I have used
docker in the past but was not something I have ever used in my workflow so it was interesting to hear his perspective.

After attending this meetup I could definitely see myself returning in the future or maybe even presenting once I feel a little more 
comfortable with the material.
